In this 4h course, I will introduce you to Matplotlib, a library for creating visualizations in Python. You will learn how to create, customize and save scientific plots. We will do several exercises to learn how to make Matplotlib fully meet our scientific needs, producing ready-to-be-published plots. We will connect via Zoom. During the first part of the course, we will do the exercises together following a Google Colaboratory notebook that will be shared in advance. During the second half, participants will work in small groups and will share their work with the whole audience.
